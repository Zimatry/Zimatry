                        <p> Once you select a tutor, a member of our team will contact you to learn more about your level and language ability, as well as where and when you prefer to have lessons. Most students get started right away, though you are welcome to schedule your first lesson for whenever is convenient for you!</p>

                        <p> Your instructor will work with you to craft a curriculum. We can accommodate online and in person lessons. If the lessons are in person, there is an additional charge of $10.00 per visit and the minimum hours for a home visit are 2 hour sessions. We also require a parent to be home at all times during any home sessions. Online sessions are billed in 15 minute increments. </p>

                        <p> What if we could supply a teacher to come in for a few hours a week and teach a class Chinese culture and language through class instruction, games and class participation. Our goal is to make learning a new language fun. We offer on-site instruction in a fun way to initiate an interest in learning Mandarin.</p>

                        <br/>


                        <h4><u>The Benefits of our Programs</u></h4>
                        <p>Schools, teachers, parents and researchers are stressing the importance of opening one’s mind to learning about and embracing other cultures, and the perspective and enrichment it brings to one’s life. Studies have shown that learning a new language can have a multitude of benefits.

                        <h6>Cognitive Benefits</h6>
                        <p>Research shows that learning a new language has many cognitive benefits, especially for children and young adults. Benefits include:
                            <li>better problem-solving skills</li>
                            <li>better critical thinking skills</li>
                            <li>more creative</li>
                            <li>better flexibility of mind</li>
                            <li>enhanced memory</li>
                            <li>better multi-tasking abilities</li>
                        </p>

                        <h6>Higher Academic Achievement</h6>
                        <p>Learning a foreign language can also provide academic benefits. The cognitive benefits listed above result in bilingual students  performing higher in an academic setting than their peers.</p>

                        <h6>Increased Cultural Understanding</h6>
                        <p>Not only does learning a foreign language result in higher academic achievement, it will enhance your resume and college applications.  The world is changing and now more than ever, language skills and cultural knowledge are important building blocks for future leaders in a global world.</p>

                        <h6>Cultural Enrichment</h6>
                        <p>Learning a foreign language opens doors that would not otherwise be opened. Bilingual (or trilingual) individuals have access to resources, people, places, and things that the rest of us do not.</p>

                        <h6>Deeper Understanding</h6>
                        <p>A foreign language provides a deeper understanding  and appreciation for different cultures, which enriches one’s life and personal experiences in the world.</p>

                        <p>Parents can sign up to have a mentor being involved on a daily basis to help with homework and test prep.  The mentor will have access to the student’s school online grades and assignments and give weekly reports to parents.  It takes the power struggle between student and parent and places it with a third person.  Fees are monthly or even school calendar year. </p>

                        <p>Do you find yourself in full-on homework battles most nights of the week? It’s no surprise that most children and teens will dig in their heels when it comes to doing schoolwork. Think of it this way: How many kids want to do something that isn’t particularly exciting or pleasant? Most would prefer to be playing video games, riding their bikes or driving around with friends, especially after a long day of school and activities.</p>

                        <p>The underlying truth here is that you and your child might already be caught in a power struggle over this. Like most parents, you probably want your children to do well and be responsible. Maybe you worry about your child’s future. After all, doing homework and chores are your child’s prime responsibilities, right? Let’s face it, it’s easy to get anxious when your kids are not doing what they’re supposed to be doing—and when you know how important doing schoolwork is. And when you believe you are ultimately responsible for the choices your child makes (and many of us do, consciously and unconsciously), the ante is upped and the tug of war begins.</p>

                        <u>Nagging, Lecturing and Yelling—But Nothing Changes?</u>

                        <p>With defiant kids, parents need to be very cognizant of working to develop positive relationships, no matter how difficult. Above all, work to avoid getting pulled into a power struggle. Your child will need many more learning opportunities and more rewards and negative consequences—and more time to learn these lessons than less defiant child. And if nothing changes, and your child continues to be defiant, you must continue to work on your own patience and be thoughtful about your own bottom line. Most important, continue to love your child and keep showing up. </p>
