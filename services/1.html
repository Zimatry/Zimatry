                        <p> Once you select a tutor, a member of our team will contact you to learn more about your level and language ability, as well as where and when you prefer to have lessons. Most students get started right away, though you are welcome to schedule your first lesson for whenever is convenient for you!</p>

                        <p> Your instructor will work with you to craft a curriculum. We can accommodate online and in person lessons. If the lessons are in person, there is an additional charge of $10.00 per visit and the minimum hours for a home visit are 2 hour sessions. We also require a parent to be home at all times during any home sessions. Online sessions are billed in 15 minute increments. </p>

                        <p> What if we could supply a teacher to come in for a few hours a week and teach a class Chinese culture and language through class instruction, games and class participation. Our goal is to make learning a new language fun. We offer on-site instruction in a fun way to initiate an interest in learning Mandarin.</p>

                        <br/>


                        <h4><u>The Benefits of our Programs</u></h4>
                        <p>Schools, teachers, parents and researchers are stressing the importance of opening oneâ€™s mind to learning about and embracing other cultures, and the perspective and enrichment it brings to oneâ€™s life. Studies have shown that learning a new language can have a multitude of benefits.

                        <h6>Cognitive Benefits</h6>
                        <p>Research shows that learning a new language has many cognitive benefits, especially for children and young adults. Benefits include:
                            <li>better problem-solving skills</li>
                            <li>better critical thinking skills</li>
                            <li>more creative</li>
                            <li>better flexibility of mind</li>
                            <li>enhanced memory</li>
                            <li>better multi-tasking abilities</li>
                        </p>

                        <h6>Higher Academic Achievement</h6>
                        <p>Learning a foreign language can also provide academic benefits. The cognitive benefits listed above result in bilingual students  performing higher in an academic setting than their peers.</p>

                        <h6>Increased Cultural Understanding</h6>
                        <p>Not only does learning a foreign language result in higher academic achievement, it will enhance your resume and college applications.  The world is changing and now more than ever, language skills and cultural knowledge are important building blocks for future leaders in a global world.</p>

                        <h6>Cultural Enrichment</h6>
                        <p>Learning a foreign language opens doors that would not otherwise be opened. Bilingual (or trilingual) individuals have access to resources, people, places, and things that the rest of us do not.</p>

                        <h6>Deeper Understanding</h6>
                        <p>A foreign language provides a deeper understanding  and appreciation for different cultures, which enriches oneâ€™s life and personal experiences in the world.</p>

                        <p>For some students, homework is interesting and a challenge. For others, it is a chore and something to be avoided at all costs. Parents can sign up to have a mentor be involved on a daily basis to help with homework and test prep. The mentor will have access to the student's online grades and assignments and give weekly reports to parents. It transfers the power struggle between student and parent and places it with a third person. Fees are monthly or even school calendar year.</p>

                        <p>Do you find yourself in full-on homework battles most nights of the week? Think of it this way: How many kids want to do something that isn't particularly exciting or pleasant? Most would prefer to be playing video games, hanging around with friends or even playing sports, all to the detriment of homework.</p>

                        <p>Homework being completed and handed in helps advance their school careers and helps increase their gpa.
